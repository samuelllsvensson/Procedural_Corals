# Procedural_Corals
Procedural Coral shaders for the course TNM084 - "Procedural Images", written in Open Shading Language (OSL)

Three different corals were created for this project, with one being generated using L-systems. 
The .blend requires Animation Nodes to see the staghorn coral node tree. 

There are 3 OSL shaders with different types of noise functions (with parameters), displacement shader and a diffuse shader to play around with.
